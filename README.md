# Simple EHR Blockchain System

A simplified Electronic Health Records (EHR) system built with blockchain technology using Python and Streamlit.

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Adding Medical Records
1. Navigate to **📝 Add Record** page
2. Fill in patient information (ID, name, age, gender)
3. Enter medical details (diagnosis, treatment, severity)
4. Specify hospital and doctor information
5. Click **🔐 Add to Blockchain** to mine and store the record

### Viewing Patient Data
1. Go to **🔍 Patient Records** page
2. Use search bar to find specific patients
3. Apply filters for severity, hospital, or doctor
4. Click on record cards to expand full details
5. Download filtered results as CSV

### Exploring the Blockchain
1. Visit **⛓️ Blockchain Explorer** page
2. View interactive blockchain structure
3. Select individual blocks to inspect
4. Validate chain integrity with one click
5. Examine cryptographic hashes and metadata

### Monitoring System Health
1. Check **🏠 Dashboard** for system overview
2. Monitor key metrics and patient statistics
3. Review recent activity and trends
4. Analyze severity distribution charts
5. Track record addition patterns over time

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Theme Modifications
- Edit CSS gradients in the `st.markdown()` section
- Modify color schemes by changing hex values
- Adjust animation timings and effects
- Customize card layouts and spacing

### Feature Extensions
- Add more patient fields (blood type, allergies, etc.)
- Implement user authentication system
- Create backup/restore functionality
- Add email notifications for new records

### Advanced Analytics
- Implement more complex chart types
- Add predictive analytics features
- Create custom reporting dashboards
- Build data correlation analysis

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Slow Loading**: Reduce animation durations in CSS
- **Memory Issues**: Clear browser cache and restart
- **Display Problems**: Check browser compatibility
- **Form Errors**: Validate all required fields are filled

### Performance Optimization
- Limit number of records displayed at once
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Optimize Plotly chart rendering
- Use session state efficiently

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment

1. Push these files to your GitHub repository:
   - `app.py`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - `README.md`

2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Deploy!

## How It Works

### Blockchain Structure
- Each medical record is stored in a block
- Blocks are linked using cryptographic hashes
- Any tampering with records would break the chain
- Genesis block initializes the blockchain

### Medical Records
Records include:
- Patient ID and Name
- Age and Doctor information
- Diagnosis and Treatment details
- Timestamp and Block hash for verification

## Usage

1. **Add Records**: Use the "Add Medical Record" page to input new patient data
2. **View All**: See all records stored in the blockchain
3. **Search**: Find specific patient records by ID
4. **Verify**: Check blockchain integrity on the info page

└── README.md          # This file
```

## Security Features

- **Immutable Records**: Once added, records cannot be changed
- **Hash Verification**: Each block is cryptographically secured
- **Chain Validation**: System can verify entire blockchain integrity
- **Timestamp Tracking**: All records include creation timestamps

## Deployment Notes

- The application stores data in memory during the session
- For production use, consider adding persistent storage
- All patient data should be handled according to HIPAA guidelines
- This is a simplified educational example
